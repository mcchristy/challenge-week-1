## About
The goal of this project was to optimize the marketing agency's website for search engines and make sure it follows accessibility standards. I needed to make sure the html was structured properly and the sementic elements were correctly labeled. I added alt attributes to the images for accessibility. Also making sure the title element is concise and descriptive.
